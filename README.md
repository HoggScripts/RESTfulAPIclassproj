# RESTful API by Ben Hogg

Learning Objectives:

Database Design and Integration:
Develop a comprehensive database schema with a minimum of 5 entities, excluding those inherent to the Identity framework.
Integrate the database seamlessly into the .NET Web API, enabling CRUD operations for data manipulation.

Logging and Monitoring:
Implement a robust logging service within the Web API to track events and errors occurring in controller methods for troubleshooting and debugging.
Cloud Deployment:

Deploy the Web API onto Azure cloud services to ensure scalability and accessibility, enhancing the project's reach and performance.
API Consumption and Documentation:

Create user-friendly documentation detailing API endpoints and functionalities, facilitating efficient consumption and integration by users.
Codebase Organization:

Establish a well-structured codebase with clear directory hierarchies and separation of concerns between classes, promoting readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.
Backend Frameworks and Technologies:

Familiarize with common backend frameworks used in .NET RESTful service development, enhancing proficiency and adaptability in diverse project environments.
Database Management and Operations:

Master database operations including schema design, scaffolding, migration, and updates using Microsoft SQL Server and Azure Data Studio, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.
Security and Authentication:

Implement secure authentication mechanisms utilizing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authorization and authentication, and leverage the Identity framework for user management functionalities.
User Registration and Validation:

Utilize MailService to streamline user registration and validation processes, enhancing user experience and system integrity.
